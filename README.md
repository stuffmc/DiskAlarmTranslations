##Disk Alarm Translations

This is "semi public" repository. It means it's not private, but I will only pull the changes from people I know are my localizers. If you'd like to help me on localizing any of the languages, [get in touch with me](http://diskalarm.com) via the *Support* link.

To open `DiskAlarm.nibTranslate`, use [**nibTranslate Light**](http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/nibtranslate-light/id419607106?mt=12), which is Free.

#Very important
**Do not** translate `MainMenu.strings` in the `.nibTranslate` file. It's (still) there because I wanna to be *smarter than I am* :-) Only modify the `Localizable.strings` and `MainMenu.xib` and please, unless you see something horrible, only modify *your* language.

Once you have changed something, commit & pull your changes, and I will then pull, and if I had to merge, push back.
