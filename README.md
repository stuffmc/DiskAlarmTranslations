##Disk Alarm Translations

This is "semi public" repository. It means it's not private, but I will only pull the changes from people I know are my localizers. If you'd like to help me on localizing any of the languages, [get in touch with me](http://diskalarm.com) via the *Support* link.

To open DiskAlarm.nibTranslate, use [**nibTranslate Light**](http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/nibtranslate-light/id419607106?mt=12), which is Free.

##Very important
**Do not** modify `MainMenu.xib` in the `.nibTranslate` file. It's just there as a *reference* to you. Only modify the `.strings` and please, unless you see something horrible, only modify *your* language.

Once you have changed something, commit & pull your changes, and I will then pull, and if I had to merge, push back.
